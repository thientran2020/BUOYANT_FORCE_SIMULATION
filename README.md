# BUOYANT FORCE SIMULATION

### Description
This is a Buoyant Force Simulation implemented using PyQt5.
I created it for my Physics 4C Final Project.

* Change the block shape and size, as well as the liquid to see how the Buoyant Force changes.
* The app will display the magnitude of the Buoyant Force exerting on the floating block and display the submerged fraction.
